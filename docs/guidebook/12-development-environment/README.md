# Development Environment

_This part of the guidebook outlines the setup required for a developer to begin working on the software.
It should include information about necessary tools, libraries, and frameworks. Instructions on setting
up a local development environment, including any specific IDE configurations, build instructions, and
other dependencies, are also crucial. This ensures that new developers can quickly get up to speed and
contributes to consistent development practices across the team._
